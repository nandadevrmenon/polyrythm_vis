# Cyclical Polyrhythm Resynchronization Visualizer

The Cyclical Polyrhythm Resynchronization Visualizer is a web-based application that allows you to explore and visualize the cyclical resynchronization of polyrhythms. This visualizer provides an interactive and dynamic representation of polyrhythms, showcasing the shifting patterns as the rhythms come in and out of alignment over cycles.

## Technologies Used

HTML5: Used for the structure and layout of the visualizer.

CSS: Styling and visual enhancements for the grid and animation.

JavaScript: The logic and animation functionality are implemented using JavaScript.

## Project Set-up
Works best on Chrome and Opera. Safari by default, does not allow media-playing with sound and even with it on, there are issues with the timing of the audios being played. One possible reason for the lag and timing issues in Safari could be related to how the browser handles audio buffering and playback. Safari may have a longer audio buffering delay or a different approach to managing audio resources compared to Chrome. This can result in delays or synchronization issues when multiple audio files are played simultaneously.
